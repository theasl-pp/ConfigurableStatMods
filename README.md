# ConfigurableStatMods

Allows most innate stats of weapons and armor to be configurable in the mod settings menu. Will not work properly with any other mods that change the same values - should be mostly compatible with TFTV, with a few exceptions (Kaos weapons for example). Most options are not tested, use at your own risk.

Each folder is its own C# Visual Studio project.

Known issues:
- Some (possibly all?) weapon effective range values are not updated in the UI, however they will be modified properly when using the weapon.

Feel free to reuse or repurpose these for other mods, just give credit.
