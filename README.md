Each folder is its own C# Visual Studio project.

Known issues:
- Some (possibly all?) weapon effective range values are not updated in the UI, however they will be modified properly when using the weapon.
- Armor values for torso and leg armor pieces do not properly carry over to individual body parts.

Feel free to reuse or repurpose these for other mods, just give credit.
