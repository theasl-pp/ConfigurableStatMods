# ConfigurableStatMods

Allows most innate stats of weapons and armor to be configurable in the mod settings menu. Will not work properly with any other mods that change the same values - should be mostly compatible with TFTV, with a few exceptions (Kaos weapons for example). Most options are not tested, use at your own risk.

Each folder is its own C# Visual Studio project.

Known issues:
- Some (possibly all?) weapon effective range values are not updated in the UI, however they will be modified properly when using the weapon.
- Armor values for torso and leg armor pieces do not properly carry over to individual body parts.

Feel free to reuse or repurpose these for other mods, just give credit.
